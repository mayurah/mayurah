### Hi there 👋 This is Mayur Pipaliya. 

At heart, I am a `hands-on builder` and `engineering practitioner`.

I enjoy driving innovation, engineering excellence, and designing scalable architectures.

Working on a most complex engineering problems gives me immense satisfaction; especially in space of fundamentals (availability, reliability, performance, and scalability), developer velocity (CD/CI, modern canary, and real user telemetry-based testing) and designing fault-tolerant, highly-available and low-latency control plane architectures. 

I am a `situational servant leader` who is always curious, learning from everyone, and executing! 

Over the last 20 years, I have served 2K+ engineering team while directly formed and led teams of various sizes (from 1 to 200+) and shapes, including product and engineering teams, engineering-only teams, forward-deployed customer engineering teams, and small but mighty groups of 8–10 delivering marvels.


## 🌟 My Core Beliefs

> My actions are centered on user empathy, rapid iteration, continuous growth, ownership, collaboration, and inclusive culture.  

- Builder and Innovator at Heart
- Medium to Large Organization (5K-90K) - Splunk, Cisco:
  -  > I believe that sustained growth can lead to transformative, long-lasting impact.
- Startup Perspective (10-5K) - BuildKit, WebCare360, Saint Peter's, HackerEarth:
  -  > I also recognize the high-stakes nature of hypergrowth in small and medium-sized organization, where rapid acceleration can unlock extraordinary success or critical challenges.
 

## 🧠 Strategic and Executive Strengths

> Planning over Guesswork: Provide clarity, spark energy, and drive successful outcomes.

- **Strategic Foresight**: Tackling complex challenges with vision.
- **Product Innovation**: Delivering impactful solutions.
- **Executive Leadership**: Driving alignment and business success.

## 🎯 Leadership Style

>  Execution over theory: Lead by example, coach for development, and care for team’s well-being.

I am a **natural leader** who:
- Shapes the vision.
- Inspires leaders and connects with members
- Picks up the baton to drive progress.
- Ensures teams stay aligned, focused, and results-driven.
