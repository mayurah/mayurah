### Hi there 👋

This is Mayur Pipaliya. I am a `situational servant leader` who is always curious, learning, and executing! 

At my core, I am a builder and innovator, driven by the belief that sustained growth in a large organization can lead to transformative, long-lasting impact. At the same time, I recognize the high-stakes nature of hypergrowth in startups, where rapid acceleration can either unlock extraordinary success or lead to critical challenges. 

Over the last 19+ years, I have formed and led teams of various sizes (from 1 to 180+) and shapes, including product and engineering teams, engineering-only teams, forward-deployed customer engineering teams, and small but mighty groups of 8–10 delivering marvels.

I enjoy the unique blend of strategic foresight, product innovation, and executive leadership to tackle complex challenges and drive business success. 

A natural leader who shapes the vision and picks up the baton to drive progress, ensuring that teams stay aligned and focused on growing and delivering results.
